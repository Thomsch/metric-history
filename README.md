# MetricHistory

MetricHistory is an extensible tool designed to collect and process software
measurements across mutiple versions of a code base. The measurement itself is
modular and executed by a third party tool. The default analyzer is
[SourceMeter](https://www.sourcemeter.com/) which offers more than 52 metrics at
the project, package, class, and method level.

Features:

- Automated collection of measurements for multiple version of a project.
- Computation of the difference in metrics between two version of a project.

On top of these features, MetricHistory offers a collection of optional
utilities:

- Conversion of native analysis results into a easily readable reference format (RAW format).
- Retrieval of the parent versions of a list of versions.
- [Incubating] Exports to mongodb database.

## Running from command line

MetricHistory comes with a rich command line interface. Every command is
explained in the `help` command (`./metric-history help`).

### Example: Collecting the metrics of a list of versions with SourceMeter

`./metric-history collect versions.txt path/to/repository/ output/folder/ path/to/sourcemeter/executable`
This command analyzes the versions given in _versions.txt_ of the project located in _repository_ using the analyzer
'Sourcemeter'. _versions.txt_ contains a list of commit ids (in case of a git project). The results are stored in
`output/folder`.

## Using the API

Inspire yourself from the example in `org.metrichistory.cmd.*`, they all use the public API!

## Building
We use Gradle to build the project and resolve dependencies automatically.
